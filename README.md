<h2>User Story<h2> 
As a user, I would like to have an application whereby I am able to submit entries privately and at the same time be able to either edit or delete them as and when I like.


<h2>Project Scope and Approach</h2>
The scope of this project is to serve as a platform for individuals who have busy schedules be able to record down any kind of information such as how an incident made them feel or details of a special moment and many more. An account would be needed in order to be able to submit any entries.

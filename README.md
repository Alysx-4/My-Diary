<h2>Project Link</h2> (

<br>


<h2>User Story<h2> 
As a user, I would like to have an application whereby I am able to submit entries privately and at the same time be able to either edit or delete them as and when I like. 

<br>


<h2>Project Scope</h2>
The scope of this project is to serve as a platform for individuals who have busy schedules to be able to record down any kind of information such as how an incident made them feel or details of a special moment and many more. Individuals would also be able to view other entries and be able to like them. 

<br> 

<h2> Technology</h2>
The technology used would be React.js, Javascript as well as Express. Due to the nature of Project 4, i would be challenging myself to use Websocket as an API instead od Mongodb. This application would also be a full CRUD application.
